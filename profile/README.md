Welcome to **Bharat Seva+**, an advanced healthcare management system designed to revolutionize healthcare delivery through scalable, high-performance, and secure backend solutions. Bharat Seva+ focuses on digitizing health records, analyzing health data to predict risks, and simplifying interactions between healthcare providers and patients. This project incorporates a **Healthcare Portal** and a **Client (Patient) Portal** to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features

- **System Design & Scalability**: Built using a microservices architecture, Bharat Seva+ is designed for high performance and scalability, making it adaptable to large-scale deployments.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Utilizes RabbitMQ for task queues, ensuring reliable message and notification processing.
- **Health Data Analytics (Upcoming)**: Plans to integrate advanced health data analysis with deep learning for personalized insights and risk prediction.
- **Secure Data Storage & Caching**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: For structured data, such as appointment logs and activity tracking.
  - **MongoDB**: For patient records and unstructured data.
  - **Redis**: For caching and rate-limiting to enhance response time and control access.
- **Traffic Management**: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer to ensure seamless scalability and redundancy.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana monitor system performance, resource usage, and critical health metrics.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub workflows and Docker Compose streamline the deployment process.

## Project Overview

**Bharat Seva+** consists of two primary applications:

1. **[Healthcare Interface](https://github.com/BharatSeva/HealthCare-Interface)**  
   Portal for healthcare professionals to manage patient logs, biodata, health records, and other essential information.

2. **[Client Interface](https://github.com/BharatSeva/Client-Interface)**  
   Patient-facing portal where clients can access records, book appointments, and interact with healthcare services.

## Features

- **Log Health Records Digitally**  
  Enables both healthcare providers and patients to log and securely store health data, from vital signs to lab results, accessible anytime from the cloud.

- **Simplified Appointment Scheduling**  
  Patients can book appointments with healthcare providers through the portal, removing the need for paper-based scheduling.

- **Predictive Health Insights* (Coming Soon)**  
  Planned updates will incorporate health data analysis for personalized insights, trends, and proactive health management.

- **Data Security and Accessibility**  
  Health records are securely stored and accessible when needed, enabling easy sharing with healthcare providers.

- **Health Data Analysis for Risk Prediction* (Coming Soon)**  
  Advanced data analysis (with future deep learning integration) will analyze health trends to predict potential risks, helping users avoid adverse health events.
