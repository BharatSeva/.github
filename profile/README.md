# Bharat Seva+

### [Watch Demo Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXRQ5AMta2AI_jZlGr0A5owICnGkDpElO&si=8AApluBocodaW-pr)

Welcome to **Bharat Seva+**, a project that I‚Äôve built using the MERN stack with Firebase integration to revolutionize healthcare management. The app connects patients with healthcare professionals, logs health records, and eliminates traditional paper-based systems. Future updates will introduce video-text messaging as well!

Healthcare professionals can search for patients for vaccinations or health check-ups, while patients can maintain their medical records digitally, reducing the chance of losing vital health data. This can potentially help in detecting symptoms early and prevent serious health conditions.

## Project Overview

This project consists of **two web apps**:

1. **Healthcare Interface** [‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/BharatSeva/BharatSeva-Plus-HealthCare-Interface)    
   A portal for healthcare professionals (HIPs) to generate and manage health logs like biodata, health records, and more.

2. **User Interface** [‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/BharatSeva/BharatSeva-Plus-User-Interface)  
   A patient-facing portal where users can access their records, make appointments, and avail other healthcare services (also refered as Patient portal or enduser).

Both interfaces work together to provide seamless healthcare management services.

## Features

### 1. Log Health Records Effortlessly  
Say goodbye to paper! **Bharat Seva+** allows healthcare providers and patients to log and store all their health data digitally. Whether it's vital signs, medications, lab results, or vaccination records, everything is securely stored in the cloud and can be accessed anytime.

### 2. Easy Appointment Scheduling  
Patients can easily schedule appointments with registered healthcare facilities through the app, eliminating the need for paper-based records.

### 3. Personalized Health Insights* (Coming Soon)  
In future updates, **Bharat Seva+** will analyze user health data and provide personalized insights, trends, and recommendations, helping users proactively manage their health.

### 4. Secure and Accessible Health Records  
Health records are stored securely in the cloud, making them easily accessible when needed and shareable with healthcare professionals.

## Current Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind  
- **Backend**: Express.js and Golang    
- **Database**: MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT (for sessions)  

---

## Roadmap

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve implemented so far:

- Two Front-end (User and Healthcare) built with React.js and Tailwind  
- **Golang** healthcare server for optimized performance, scalability, and concurrency
- **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data
- **RabbitMQ** ensures the application can process tasks asynchronously.  
- **Python Consumer** Service for logs, appointment, medical records, and email notifications.
- **PostgreSQL** to handle advance querying, and to perform large data analytics.
- **Node.js** user server, built with Express.js.  
- **Docker** for containerization
- MongoDB and Firebase as the database
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT for authentication and session management

## Target : Scale this application for Massive 50 Million Users üöÄ
### Upcoming Features:
- **NGINX** for Traffic Management and Load balancing
- **Prometheus and Grafana** to collect and stores metric data as time-series data, and for analytics and visualization of Express application.
- **Elasticsearch** for search functionality of healthcare

### Future Plans:
- Transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices
- Continuously improve code quality to ensure long-term maintainability
