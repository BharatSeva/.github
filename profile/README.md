# Bharat Seva+

### [Watch Demo Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXRQ5AMta2AI_jZlGr0A5owICnGkDpElO&si=8AApluBocodaW-pr)

Welcome to **Bharat Seva+**, a project that I’ve built using the MERN stack with Firebase integration to revolutionize healthcare management. The app connects patients with healthcare professionals, logs health records, and eliminates traditional paper-based systems. Future updates will introduce video-text messaging as well!

Healthcare professionals can search for patients for vaccinations or health check-ups, while patients can maintain their medical records digitally, reducing the chance of losing vital health data. This can potentially help in detecting symptoms early and prevent serious health conditions.

## Project Overview

This project consists of **two web apps**:

1. **Healthcare Interface** [visit](https://bharatsevaplus-healthcare.netlify.app/)  
   A portal for healthcare professionals (HIPs) to generate and manage health logs like biodata, health records, and more.

2. **User Interface** [visit](https://bharatsevaplus-user.netlify.app/)  
   A patient-facing portal where users can access their records, make appointments, and avail other healthcare services.

Both interfaces work together to provide seamless healthcare management services.
